    <p>
      CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to
      <span class="highlight"> create great-looking web pages</span>, but how
      does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is with a
      simple syntax example and also covers some key terms about the language.

      In the Introduction to HTML module, we covered what HTML is and how it is
      used to mark up documents. These
      <span class="highlight">documents will be readable</span> in a web
      browser.
      <span class="highlight"
        >Headings will look larger than regular text, paragraphs break onto a
        new line and have space between them. Links are colored and
        underlined</span
      >
      to distinguish them from the rest of the text. What you are seeing are the
      <span class="highlight"
        >browser's default styles — very basic styles — that the browser applies
        to HTML</span
      >
      to make sure that the page will be basically readable even if no explicit
      styling is specified by the author of the page.

        The browser will style HTML documents using an
        <span class="highlight">internal stylesheet</span>. This ensures that
        the headings are larger than normal text, links are highlighted and
